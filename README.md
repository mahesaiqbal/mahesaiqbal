### 👨‍💻 About Me

&emsp; Currently, I am working at a state-owned bank in Indonesia, **Bank Mandiri**.
In my current job, I have developed an internal apps for **Smart Branches** spread across various regions in Indonesia to help customers' banking transactions with an Android apps called **NBDS (New Branch Delivery System)**.

&emsp; After that, I was appointed to develop another Bank Mandiri Android apps called **Livin' Merchant**. This apps acts as a POS (Point of Sales) System made for entrepreneurs such as cafes, foods & beverages, barbershops, and other types of businesses to handle transactions for selling their products to customers.

&emsp; Previously, I had experiences to develop Android apps for end-to-end customer-to-business such as **Digital Banking (Amar Bank)**, **OTT Video/Streaming on-demand (Mola)**, **Point of Sales (Pawoon)**, and **Smart Locker for delivery and pick-up (PopBox)**.

&emsp; In my work experience so far, I have made achievements that can boost productivity in a team, especially in the Mobile (Android) team 🚀. These are:
- ✅ Optimizing build time on the New Branch Delivery System (NBDS) project by 60% faster, this can help in the time needed to build Android apps.
- ✅ Migrating from Kotlin + XML in several features such as Login and OTP authentication used in all banking transaction authentication, to Jetpack Compose, the aim is to minimize the number of issues on the UI side, reduce development time and stay aligned with current modern trends.
- ✅ Efficiency in time spent by QA (Quality Assurance) is 50% faster than the previous apk/aab file when performing automation tests by optimizing the code on all XML screens in the Amar Bank apps.
- ✅ Increase crash-free rates on the Amar Bank apps from 97% to 99%, this greatly impacts the user's comfort when performing an activity with the app without having a crash.
